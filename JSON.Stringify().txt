<!--let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  toString() {
    return `{name: "${this.name}", age: ${this.age}}`;
  }
};

alert(user); // {name: "John", age: 30}
…But in the process of development, new properties are added, old properties are renamed and removed. Updating such toString every time can become a pain. We could try to loop over properties in it, but what if the object is complex and has nested objects in properties? We’d need to implement their conversion as well.

Luckily, there’s no need to write the code to handle all this. The task has been solved already.

Doesnot stringify nested objects if not specified.
