<!--Transforming objects
Objects lack many methods that exist for arrays, e.g. map, filter and others.

If weâ€™d like to apply them, then we can use Object.entries followed by Object.fromEntries:

Use Object.entries(obj) to get an array of key/value pairs from obj.
Use array methods on that array, e.g. map, to transform these key/value pairs.
Use Object.fromEntries(array) on the resulting array to turn it back into an object-->
